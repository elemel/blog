# Stitched faces between equal-sized neighbor chunks

After much confusion and some trial-and-error, I managed to stitch together equal-sized neighbor chunks along their faces. Drawing some almost unrelated doodles in Gimp helped me sort out multiple mistakes. Left to do:

1. Stitch equal-sized chunks along edges (four chunks per seam)
2. Stitch smaller and larger chunks (three or four chunks per seam)

Step 1 shouldn't be too hard, but I dread taking step 2 with my current approach, which involves a lot of copying and pasting. There will be a lot of different cases when stitching smaller chunks together with larger ones.
