# Terrain chunks without seams

Here is a screenshot of the terrain of a small green planet with a white building in Unity. The terrain is defined by a signed distance field. The terrain is divided into chunks, where each chunk has a mesh generated by dual contouring of the signed distance field. The terrain chunks live in an octree, where they will refine (subdivide) or collapse based on viewer (camera) distance. The next step is to stitch together the terrain chunks at the seams.
