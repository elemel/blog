# Terrain chunks with gaps

Behold a small green planet with a tall white building in the Unity game engine. We divide the terrain of the planet into chunks, where each chunk has a mesh generated by applying the dual contouring algorithm on a signed distance field. The terrain chunks are organized in an octree, where they will refine (subdivide) or collapse based on viewer (camera) distance. The next step is to stitch together the terrain chunks at the seams, filling those ugly gaps.
