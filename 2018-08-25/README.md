# Terrain chunks without seams

Here is a screenshot of the terrain of a small green planet with a white building. We divide the terrain into chunks, where the geometry of each chunk is a mesh generated by applying the dual contouring algorithm on a signed distance field. The terrain chunks are organized in an octree, where they will refine (subdivide) or collapse based on viewer (camera) distance. The next step is to stitch together the terrain chunks at the seams.
