# Terrain chunks without seams

Here is a screenshot of terrain defined by a signed distance field in Unity. The terrain is divided into chunks, where each chunk has a mesh generated by dual contouring. The terrain chunks will live in an octree, where they will refine (subdivide) or collapse based on viewer (camera) distance. The next step is to stitch together the terrain chunks at the seams.
